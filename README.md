## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tyler Weaver (he/him)
Building robust software with others is my jam.
Professionally I work in open-source robotics, and before that, I wrote signal processing code.
In 1999 I started programming with the book "C in 21 Days".
Having written C++ for as long as I can remember, I've fallen in love with the Rust programming language.
I am currently contributing to [Clippy](https://doc.rust-lang.org/clippy/), the Rust linter.
My motivation is to develop muscle memory in Rust and to make friends in the Rust community.
Below are links to my PRs for Clippy and my robotics work for [PickNik Robotics](https://picknik.ai/).
