## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tyler Weaver (he/him)
Building robust software with others is my jam.
Professionally, I work in open-source robotics, and before that, I wrote signal processing code.
In 1999, I started programming with the book "C in 21 Days".
Having written C++ for as long as I can remember, I've fallen in love with the Rust programming language.
