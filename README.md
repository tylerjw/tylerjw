## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tyler Weaver (he/him)
Rust is the future, C++ is here to stay, and the two should be friends.

Recently, I became a free agent and am focusing on these two things:
- C++ packaging
- Rust/C++ Interop

Professionally, I have worked in open-source robotics and signal processing.

### C++ Packaging
- [cps-config](https://github.com/cps-org/cps-config) Drop in replacement for pkg-config based on .cps files
- [cps-build](https://github.com/tylerjw/cps-deps) Generate .cps files from .pc files
- [ubuntu-jammy-cps](https://github.com/tylerjw/ubuntu-jammy-cps) CPS files for Ubuntu Jammy (22.04)

### ðŸ¦€ C++/Rust Interop
- [C++ Interop Part 1 - Just The Basics](https://tylerjw.dev/posts/rust-cpp-interop/)
- [C++ Interop Part 2 - CMake](https://tylerjw.dev/posts/rust-cmake-interop-cmake/)
- [C++ Interop Part 3 - Cxx](https://tylerjw.dev/posts/rust-cmake-interop-part-3-cxx/)
- [C++ Interop Part 4 - Binding to a C++/CMake/Conan Project](https://tylerjw.dev/posts/rust-cpp-part4-buildrs/)
 
### ðŸ“¢ Talks
