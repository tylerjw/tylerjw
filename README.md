## Hi ðŸ‘‹, I'm Tyler Weaver (he/him)
Rust is the future, C++ is here to stay, and the two should be friends.

Recently, I became a free agent and am focusing on these two things:
- Rust/C++ Interop
- Tooling for packaging (specifically CPS and Pixi)

Professionally, I have worked in open-source robotics and signal processing.
I am available for consulting. Please feel free to reach out for details.
